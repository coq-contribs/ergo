Ergo: a Coq plugin for reification of term with arbitrary signature
========================================================
Copyright 2010 St√©phane Lescuyer <stephane.lescuyer@inria.fr>

Features
========

This plugin provides a couple of tactics for the reification of Coq
formulae with terms in arbitrary signature. This extension is limited
to non-dependent types.  Here are some of the tactics provided:

 - [build_conjunction id]
  Builds the conjunction of all hypotheses of type [Prop] in the
  context, and adds the resulting proposition to the context with the
  name [id].

 - [ergo_reify f reif v]
  This tactic reifies the hypothesis with name [f] in the context, in
  a reified formula [reif] and stores the various varmaps for the
  interpretation of term and propositional variables in [v].

 - [valid_prepare]
  Checks that [Coq.Logic.Classical_Prop] is imported, in other words that
  the user is working with classical logic, and applies double negation
  to the goal. The only interest of this tactic is to be used with the
  reflexive [ergo] tactic since it provides a comprehensive error message.

Also, an extra vernacular command for debug purposes is provided:
 - [PrintAst t]
 Prints the structure of the internal AST of term [t].

Files
=====

The archive has 3 subdirectories:
src/ contains the code of the plugin in ergo.ml and
     a support file for building the plugin.

theories/ contains Term.v for the definition of reified terms, and
	  Ergo.v used to load the plugin on the Coq side.

tests/ just demonstrates a use of the plugin

Installation
============

First, you should have coqc, ocamlc and make in your path.
Then simply do:

# coq_makefile -f make > Makefile

To generate a makefile from the description in Make, then [make].
This will consecutively build the plugin, the supporting
theories and the test file.

You can then either install the plugin with

# sudo ./install.sh

or leave it in its current directory and to be able to import it
from anywhere in Coq, simply add the following to ~/.coqrc:

Add Rec LoadPath "path_to_ergo/theories" as Ergo.
Add ML Path "path_to_ergo/src".
